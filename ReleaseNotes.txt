Features added in Version 15.04
-------------------------------
This is the first official release of AllJoyn.js, what follows is an overview of
the project and its features (which can also be found on the AllSeen [wiki]).

AllJoyn.js integrates AllJoyn Thin Client with Base Services and the Duktape
JavaScript engine and runtime environment. The Duktape JS engine has support for
full ECMAScript 5.0 features as well as some borrowed features from the E6
draft. AllJoyn.js includes two high level modules, AllJoyn and IO. The AllJoyn
module provides wrappers for Thin Client functionality like making method calls,
sending signals, getting/setting properties. It also provides API’s for base
services functionality including Control Panel, Config, Notification, and
Onboarding. The IO module exposes API’s to manipulate real hardware like GPIO,
PWM, ADC, DAC, I2C, SPI, and UART (Note: This functionality is platform specific
and dependent on the target's BSP). AllJoyn.js also supports real time
debugging, exposed via an AllJoyn interface, which allows you to set
breakpoints, step line by line through code, evaluate JS on the fly, and
manipulate variables in real time.

Other features include:
- Over-the-air script installation
- Lockdown feature for product deployment and security
- Console service to interact with an AllJoyn.js device
- Python GUI debugger (using the console service)
- 100% event driven, non-blocking
- Low memory footprint (128K RAM minimum, 500K flash minimum)
